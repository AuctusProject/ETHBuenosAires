# Smart Accounts & Pluggable Smart Contracts 
## ETHBuenosAires Project
### Auctus Team (Ariny, Gusman, Vitorino, Duarte)

Smart accounts are smart contracts meant to be used as wallets (they hold and transfer ETH and tokens) and that can be expanded using external plugins.

## Getting Started

The platform is being built in C#, using the .NET Core framework. The API that connects to the Ethereum testnet is in the folder /EthereumModule.

## For Developers

```
npm install  
```
